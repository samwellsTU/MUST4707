    <h1>JavaScript Basics: Introduction to Arrays</h1>

    <h2>What is an Array?</h2>
    <p>
      An array in JavaScript is a single variable used to store different
      elements. It is a list of items that are stored in square brackets
      <code>[]</code>. Each item in an array is called an element, and each
      element is accessed by its numerical index.
    </p>

    <h2>Creating an Array</h2>
    <p>
      You can create an array by listing values separated by commas inside
      square brackets. For example:
      <code>let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Accessing Array Elements</h2>
    <p>
      You can access elements of an array by referring to the index number.
      Remember, arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed: the first element is at
      index 0.
    </p>

    <h2>Modifying Array Elements</h2>
    <p>
      Arrays are mutable, meaning you can change their elements. For instance,
      you can change the second item in the fruits array by doing
      <code>fruits[1] = "blueberry";</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Array Methods and Properties</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript arrays come with built-in methods and properties. For example,
      <code>length</code> gives you the number of elements in an array, and
      methods like <code>push()</code> and <code>pop()</code> allow you to add
      and remove elements.
